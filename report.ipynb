    "In mobile robotics, fusing computer vision and sensor-based feedback is essential to establish reliable global navigation algorithms, motion control strategies, and sensor-based local obstacle avoidance to enable robots to intelligently and reliably navigate through dynamic environments. This report describes our effort to develop a solution that enables the Thymio robot to traverse a terrain containing obstacles and to reach a goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project integrates multiple technologies to improve the navigation precision. With the help of a video feed provided by a camera, computer vision is used to detect the map, the obstacles in the map, the Thymio robot, and the goal. Based on this information, a 2d grid of cells is constructed. The global navigation aspect employs the Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the shortest path from the Thymio to the goal, accounting for dynamically changing events, such as kidnapping where the Thymio or the goal are displaced. The motion control mechanism guided the Thymio along the calculated path which is discretized into intermediate points, facilitating a smooth and precise traversal. For local obstacle avoidance, the Thymio relies on its proximity sensors, allowing it to detect and navigate around obstacles not identified by the computer vision part. This ensures robust navigation, even when visual data is limited. The implementation of the Kalman filter for position and orientation estimation plays a pivotal role in this project. The filter combines information from the computer vision part and the wheel speeds of the Thymio to improve robustness of the navigation. The filter is even capable of functioning when the camera feed is obscured for a while, showing the robustness of our system.\n",

    "Our Kalman filter implementation serves a critical role in the position and orientation estimation of our Thymio.

    "##### Wheel Speed Measurements\n",
    "The wheel speed measurements are used for both estimating the position and orientation of the Thymio. A refinement was introduced by incorporating a max-min constraint, to mitigate the impact of noise on the speed sensors. This addition serves to limit the potential noise-induced variations in the sensor readings, contributing to a more stable and reliable interpretation of the Thymio robot's speed information. To predict the new orientation, the angular velocity is calculated based on the difference of wheel speeds and a baseline minimum period for a 360° turn of the Thymio. "

    "##### Prediction and Update Step\n",

    "As the provided orientation input from our computer vision module is a float between 0 and 2π, depending on the Thymio's orientation, there may be jumps in the estimated orientation from 0 to 2π and vice versa. This leads to large jumps in the overall estimation of the orientation. To combat that, we do not limit the predicted orientation to [0, 2π] but let it be any number and scale using the mod operation only when the navigation part accesses it. This dramatically improved the orientation estimation of our filter.\n",

    "<a id=\"adaptability-vision\"></a>\n",
    "##### Adaptability to Vision Feed Cut-Off\n",
    "Whenever the camera feed is unavailable, the Kalman filter continues to estimate the postition and orientation based solely on the predictions derived from the wheel speed measurements. This allows the Thymio to maintain knowledge of its position and orientation even when external measurements are unavailable\n",

    "The Kalman filter's ability to combine information from wheel speed measurements and vision data drastically increases the robustness of our navigation and even allows for accurate driving when no computer vision data is available."
