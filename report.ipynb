    "In mobile robotics, fusing computer vision and sensor-based feedback is essential to establish reliable global navigation algorithms, motion control strategies, and sensor-based local obstacle avoidance to enable robots to intelligently and reliably navigate through dynamic environments. This report describes our effort to develop such a solution to enable Thymio robots to traverse a terrain containing obstacles to reach a goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project integrates multiple technologies to improve the navigation precision. With the help of a video feed provided by a camera, computer vision is used to detect the map, the obstacles in the map, the Thymio robot, and the goal. Based on this information, a 2d grid of cells is constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The global navigation aspect employs the Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the shortest path from the Thymio to the goal, accounting for dynamically changing events, such as kidnapping where the Thymio or the goal are displaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motion control mechanism guided the Thymio along the calculated path which is discretized into intermediate points, facilitating a smooth and precise traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "For local obstacle avoidance, the Thymio relies on its proximity sensors, allowing it to detect and navigate around obstacles not identified by the computer vision part. This ensures robust navigation, even when visual data is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the Kalman filter for position and orientation estimation plays a pivotal role in this project. The filter combines information from the computer vision part and the wheel speeds of the Thymio to improve robustness of the navigation. The filter is even capable of functioning when the camera feed is obscured for a while, showing the robustness of our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report details the design, implementation, and performance of our solution and shows how the combination of sensors and data can drastically improve the capabilities and precision in robotic navigation."
